# RPL challenges

Challenge problems from the end of each chapter in the book The Rust Programming Language by Steve Klabnik and Carol Nichols

All problems are completed according to prompts, but without referencing answers. I'm not ever totally sure where to find the "correct" answers to these.

### Chapter 3

    * Fahrenheit -> Celsius converter
    * Fibonacci Sequence Indexer
    * 12 Days of Christmas 

### Chapter 8

    * Command-line calculator that takes any length string of numbers and returns mean, median, and mode.
